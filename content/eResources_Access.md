Electronic Resources, or eResources, are ebooks, ejournals, streaming films, that can be accessed online by UBC graduate students anywhere with their CWL Accounts.
 
Open Access Resources are a powerfull tool, especially for students that still do not have access to their CWL account, and for alumni.
