# Video Transcript

Before we begin, we wanted to let you know that UBC has 2 campuses: UBC Vancouver and UBC Okanagan. If you are a UBC Okanagan student, some things might look different for you, but you can still benefit from this video.
UBC Library services are available even when our branches are physically closed. You can always access e-resources on the library website, but if you’re in Vancouver, you can also request physical items through the UBC Library Materials Pick-Up service. This service allows you to request physical items in the library’s collection, which we will get for you and they will be ready to pick up in about 10 days.
You can place a request for a material to be picked up right on the item’s catalogue record.

This is the UBC Library webpage.
At the page, click on Use the Library, scroll down to Borrowing services and select Materials Pick-Up Services.
Here, you will find a description of the service, and information on how to place and pick up an order. You will also find the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

Let’s say we want to borrow a book. We go back to the library home, and, on the general tab, we type in, let’s say, The wolves in the Walls. We hit search and we are directed to another page, where we can see the results. The wolves in the walls is the first result and, clicking on it, we are directed to the record of the book, available at the Education Library. To the right side of the page, there’s the Get It button, which we’ll click on and be directed to another page, which requires our CWL login to connect and place your order.

When your order is ready for pick up, you will get a notification from the UBC Library via e-mail, and you will pick up your materials at Koerner library, highlighted on the map.
We also highlighted IKB Learning Centre, where you can book a space to study, Monday through Saturday. This space includes access to desktop computers, printing and scanning, and it is organized to ensure safe physical distancing at all times. Remember: masks are required in UBC buildings now.
All other UBC Library branches are closed but we wanted you to get an idea of the available services and branches. If you visit hours dot library dot ubc dot ca, you will get accurate information on each branch opening hours and available services.

Back at the UBC Library webpage, there’s a yellow “Read More” banner. 
Here, on the Library Services Updates page, you can book a study space in IKBLC. 
Read the Safety and Space Use Guidelines before you book it.
Click on the Book a Space in IKBLC button. Scroll down to find a calendar, and also that this is a pretty busy service. You can select other days, and, when you find a green spot, you can select it and, at the bottom of the page, you will find an option with the chosen time slot. Press the Continue button to login with your CWL account, and book a study space
