# Introduction & Welcome

Are you a graduate student and new to UBC? This basic orientation will briefly introduce you to resources, services and people at UBC Library.

## Land acknowledgement

Before beginning the workshop, we'd like to acknowledge the indigenous lands where we are located.    

UBC is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), səl̓ilwətaɁɬ təməxʷ (Tsleil-Waututh), Stz'uminus, S’ólh Téméxw (Stó:lō), Skwxwú7mesh-ulh Temíx̱w (Squamish), and Coast Salish peoples.

Please take a moment to explore [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/) so that you can visualize the indigenous territories, languages, and treaties in your area.
